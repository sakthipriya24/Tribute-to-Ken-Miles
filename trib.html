        <p id="tribute-info">Kenneth Henry Miles was a race driver hired by Shelby who was a dearest friend to Shelby's owner. He was the one who stands for the word called <u>Up to the Speed</u>. I am amazed about the man who won <b>24 hours of Daytona and 12 hours of Sebring </b> in 1966 and still placed second at <b> Le-mans.</b> Some where he blessed with such a friend named, Caroll Shelby even there he had no good times through out his life onto racing.</p>
